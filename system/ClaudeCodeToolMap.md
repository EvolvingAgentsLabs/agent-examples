  web_fetch_10kb: "$0.045"
  summarization_5kb: "$0.120"
  translation_1kb: "$0.030"
```

### Time-Based Costs
```yaml
operational_costs:
  compute_time: "included in token costs"
  network_latency: "external dependency"
  storage_operations: "minimal overhead"
  
efficiency_factors:
  parallel_execution: "reduces wall-clock time"

```
