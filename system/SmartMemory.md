## Tool Performance Insights

### High-Performing Tool Combinations
- **RealWebFetchTool + RealSummarizationAgent**: Excellent for research workflows
- **RealFileSystemTool + TranslationTool**: Perfect for multilingual document processing
- **FileWriterTool + organized directory structure**: Improves output accessibility
- **Parallel web fetching**: Reduces latency for multi-source research

### Common Failure Patterns
- **Sequential web requests**: Use parallel fetching instead
- **Large document processing without chunking**: Implement progressive processing
- **Missing backup strategies**: Always use FileWriterTool backup features
- **Insufficient error handling**: Add retry logic for network operations

## Cost Optimization Discoveries

### Efficient Strategies
- **Web content caching**: 15-minute cache reduces repeat costs by 40%
- **Batch file operations**: Process multiple files in single tool calls
- **Smart summarization**: Use appropriate summary length to minimize tokens
