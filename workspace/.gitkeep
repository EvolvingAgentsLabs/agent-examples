# This file ensures the workspace directory structure is preserved in git
# while keeping the actual workspace content out of version control

# Workspace directories should contain:
# - execution_state.md (during active executions)  
# - User data and generated outputs
# - Temporary files and cache

# These are typically excluded from version control
# but the directory structure itself should be maintained
