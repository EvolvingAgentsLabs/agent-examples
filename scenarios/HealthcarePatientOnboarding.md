- **Partial Processing**: Continue with available information
- **Status Tracking**: Maintain detailed progress records

## Quality Metrics

### Success Indicators

## Training Data Generation

This scenario generates rich training data including:
- Form processing accuracy examples
- Insurance verification patterns
- Scheduling optimization strategies
- Compliance checking procedures
- Error handling and recovery workflows

## Compliance Considerations

### HIPAA Requirements
- **Data Encryption**: All patient data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access to patient information
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all data access and modifications
- **Consent Management**: Proper consent collection and documentation

### Privacy Protection
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary information
- **Purpose Limitation**: Use data only for onboarding purposes
- **Retention Policies**: Follow healthcare data retention requirements
- **Breach Response**: Procedures for handling potential data breaches
