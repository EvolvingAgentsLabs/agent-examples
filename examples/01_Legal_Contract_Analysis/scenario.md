### User Goal
I have a new service agreement from a vendor. Please act as a paralegal, review the attached contract, and give me a summary of the key terms, including the parties involved, the effective date, the term length, payment details, and any potential risks or non-standard clauses I should be aware of. The contract text is: """SERVICE AGREEMENT This Agreement is made effective as of January 1, 2025, between Innovate Corp ("Client"), and Solutions LLC ("Provider"). TERM: This Agreement shall commence on the effective date and continue for a period of twelve (12) months, automatically renewing unless terminated with 90 days notice. PAYMENT: Client shall pay Provider a monthly fee of $5,000.00, due within 15 days of invoice receipt.
